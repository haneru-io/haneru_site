# What are Collections?

Collections are the organised groups of products in your store that make naivgation for customers easy. Think of it as the different sections you encounter in a department store, you'll have a section for jackets, t-shirts, footwear etc. Collections in Shopify work the same way.

## Types of Collection

There are two primary types of collection:

1 - Manual Collections - you pick and add the products yourself. This can be useful in certain use-cases but for most catalogues I would recommend using Smart Collections.

2 - Smart Colletions - you define the conditions of the collection prior to creation. From then on, any product that matches the condition will be automatically added. Let's take a look at a practical example.

An easy way to ensure products of a similar type are automatically added to the correct category is with the use of tags.

In the case of our demo store, we want to ensure all of our jackets that are tagged with 'Jacket' get automatically added to the Jackets collection. This automation based on conditions is a far more efficient method than manually adding a product to the relevant collection each time. This becomes more apparent as your catalog grows.

Once we've added the correct tag, the store will present the relevant products. Below is an example from the demo store.

Now that we have added our jackets to the colleciton, we can look at the other options available to us. 

## Collection Settings

Beneath the conditions for what goes in to our collection you'll find the products that have been added a long with multiple options for how you want to order the products themselves.

The default will be best selling, however you should opt for what is the best fit for your catalog. Selecting "Manual" will allow you to manually drag and drop your products to the order you require.

## SEO Settings

Next, you will find the Search Engine Listing section. This area controls how your collection appears in search results on platforms like Google. The Page Title is the clickable headline that shows up in search results, while the Meta Description is the short snippet of text that sits underneath it. Together, these two fields play a big role in attracting visitors to your store. It’s recommended to write a clear, keyword-rich title that includes the main theme of your collection (for example: “Chore Jackets – Handmade in England” instead of just "Jackets"). For the meta description, keep it around 150–160 characters and focus on accurately describing what your users will find in this collection, while also encouraging them to click through. Think of it as a mini-advertisement for your collection.

The URL field allow you to alter the page URL if you require an alternative. By default the URL slug will be the name of the collection

# What are Collections?

Collections are the organised groups of products in your store that make naivgation for customers easy. Think of it as the different sections you encounter in a department store, you'll have a section for jackets, t-shirts, footwear etc. Collections in Shopify work the same way.

There are two primary types of collection:

1 - Manual Collections - you pick and add the products yourself. This can be useful in certain use-cases but for most catalogues I would recommend using Smart Collections.

2 - Smart Colletions - you define the conditions of the collection prior to creation. From then on, any product that matches the condition will be automatically added. Let's take a look at a practical example.

An easy way to ensure products of a similar type are automatically added to the correct category is with the use of tags.

In the case of our demo store, we want to ensure all of our jackets that are tagged with 'Jacket' get automatically added to the Jackets collection. This automation based on conditions is a far more efficient method than manually adding a product to the relevant collection each time. This becomes more apparent as your catalog grows.

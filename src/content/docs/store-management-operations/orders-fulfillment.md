# Orders & Fulfillment Basics

Managing orders efficiently is critical for providing a smooth customer experience and maintaining operational efficiency. Shopify’s order and fulfillment system allows you to track, process, and ship orders with ease.

This guide covers the essentials of Shopify order management, including viewing orders, processing fulfillment, and handling returns.

## 1. Viewing Orders

All customer orders appear in the **Orders** section of your Shopify admin.

- Navigate to **Orders** in the left-hand menu.  
- Each order shows:
  - Customer name and email
  - Order number
  - Status (Paid, Fulfilled, Unfulfilled, etc.)
  - Total amount
  - Payment and shipping information

## 2. Processing Orders

Once an order is received, you can process it by:

1. Clicking on the order to view details.  
2. Verifying payment and shipping information.  
3. Checking inventory availability for all products.  

### Fulfillment Options

- **Manual Fulfillment:** You mark items as fulfilled yourself and enter tracking numbers.  
- **Automatic Fulfillment:** Shopify or an integrated app fulfills the order automatically when conditions are met.

## 3. Printing Shipping Labels

Shopify allows you to purchase and print shipping labels directly from the order page:

- Select the order and click **Create shipping label**.  
- Choose the carrier, package size, and shipping speed.  
- Print the label and attach it to your package.  

> Using Shopify labels helps integrate tracking automatically into your customer notifications.

## 4. Tracking & Notifications

Shopify automatically updates the order status and notifies customers via email when:

- Tracking numbers are added  
- Shipping updates occur  

You can customize these notifications in **Settings → Notifications**.

Data is one of the most powerful tools for growing your Shopify store. Understanding your sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior allows you to make informed decisions that improve revenue and operational efficiency.

Shopify provides a suite of analytics tools, ranging from pre-built reports to **ShopifyQL**, a query language designed to extract custom insights from your storeâ€™s data.

## 1. Built-In Shopify Reports

Shopify includes a number of built-in reports depending on your plan:

- **Dashboard Overview:** Quick view of total sales, orders, top products, and returning customer stats.
- **Sales Reports:** Analyze total sales, sales by product, sales by channel, and more.
- **Customer Reports:** Understand repeat customers, location, lifetime value, and segmentation.
- **Acquisition Reports:** Track which channels bring the most traffic and conversions.

These reports are excellent for a high-level overview, but sometimes you need custom queries to dig deeper.

## 2. ShopifyQL for Custom Queries

ShopifyQL is a lightweight query language specifically designed for Shopify analytics. You can use it to create **custom reports**, export data, or explore trends not covered by standard reports.

### **Basic Query Example: Total Sales by Product**

```sql
FROM sales
  SHOW quantity_ordered
  GROUP BY product_title WITH TOTALS
  SINCE 2025-01-01 UNTIL 2025-12-31
  ORDER BY quantity_ordered DESC
  LIMIT 10
VISUALIZE quantity_ordered
```

This query gives you the top 10 best-selling products for the year 2025.

```sql
FROM sales
  SHOW total_sales
  GROUP BY customer_name
  ORDER BY total_sales DESC
  LIMIT 20
VISUALIZE total_sales
``` 

Here we identify your top 20 highest spend customers based on purchase history.

description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

Welcome!

If you’ve spent time digging through the official Shopify documentation and still couldn’t find the answers you were looking for, you’re not alone. More than once, I’ve searched for a solution, found a “resolved” thread on the forums, and come away just as confused.

The goal of this site is to fill in those gaps and go beyond the surface-level explanations Shopify provides. This isn’t a knock on their documentation—it’s great for what it is—but it can’t possibly cover every use case or edge case developers run into.

There’s no fluff here, no regurgitated docs—just honest, practical insights to help you actually get things done with Shopify.

## Recommended Step

- [Sign up to Shopify](https://accounts.shopify.com/signup) and create your first store. If you already have one, great! Let's build.

:::note
We will be using Shopify's default [Fabric](hhttps://themes.shopify.com/themes/fabric/styles/fabric) as our jumping off point for the demo store.

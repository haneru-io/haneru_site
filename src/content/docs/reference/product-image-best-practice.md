As an online retailer images are arguably the most important element invovled in selling your product. Imagery not only goes a long way to assisting a potential buyer but also how your site performs. Therefore we're going to cover some important things to consider when uploading images.

### Image Size

Not to be confused with file size (covered below) - image size refers to the exact height and width of your image, most commonly measured in pixels. The main consideration is not making the image too large as this will force the browser to needlessly load a large image on a small viewport. (Shopify recommended dimensions linked at the bottom).

### File Size

This is effecively the "digital space" the image occupies on your server. It is usually measureed in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB). Large file sizes often mean more detail in an image but don't be fooled, excessively large images will severely impact performance. Ideally this will be kept under 1MB when uploading to your site. Tools such as TinyPNG or ImageOptim are very useful for reducing file size without compromising quality. This will go a long way to improving the overall speed of your website.

### Aspect Ratio

Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of an image â€” shown as two numbers like 16:9 (landscape) or 4:5 (portrait). It tells you the shape of the image, not the size.

Given that a large number of users are on a mobile device, it's important to consider both portait and landscape viewports.

Shopify often allows you to upload different versions of an image based on desktop or mobile, so ensure you're uploading the correct ratio in each use case to avoid any unexpected cropping.

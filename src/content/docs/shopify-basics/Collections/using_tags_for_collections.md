One of Shopify’s most powerful features is the ability to create **automated collections**. Instead of adding products to a collection one by one, you can set up rules that automatically group products based on things like product tags, vendor, price, or inventory. This keeps your store organized and saves time, especially if you have a large catalog.

---

## Step 1: Create a New Collection

1. In your Shopify admin, go to **Products > Collections**.
2. Click **Create Collection**.
3. Enter a title and description for your collection (e.g., _“Summer Sale Items”_ or _“T-Shirts Under $30”_).

---

## Step 2: Choose Automated Collection Type

- Under **Collection type**, select **Automated**.
- You’ll now see options to add **Conditions**.

---

## Step 3: Set Your Conditions

Conditions let you define the rules for what products appear in the collection. You can choose to match:

- **All conditions** (products must meet every rule you set), or
- **Any condition** (products appear if they match at least one rule).

Common condition types include:

- **Product tag** → Add tags like `jackets`, `sale`, or `new` to your products, and then set your collection to automatically include them.
- **Product title** → Great for grouping products that share a keyword in their name.
- **Vendor** → Group all products from the same brand or supplier.
- **Price / Compare-at price** → Useful for “Under $XX” or “On Sale” collections.
- **Stock status** → Create a collection that only shows items currently in stock.

**Example:**

- Collection: _Chore Jackets_
- Condition: _Product tag is equal to `jacket`_
- Result: Every product with the tag `jacket` is automatically added.

## Step 4: Keep It Organized with Tags

Tags are one of the simplest and most flexible ways to manage collections.

- Add descriptive tags when editing your products (e.g., `organic`, `cotton`, `handmade`).
- Then set up collections that use those tags as conditions.
- Whenever you tag a new product, it will instantly appear in the right collection — no extra steps needed.

---

## Step 5: Save and Preview

Once your conditions are set:

1. Click **Save**.
2. Scroll down to the **Products** section to preview which items match your rules.
3. If needed, adjust your tags or conditions until the collection looks right.

---

## Tips for Smart Collections

- Use **consistent naming conventions** for tags (e.g., always lowercase, avoid spaces like `t-shirt` instead of `T Shirt`).
- Mix and match conditions — for example:
  - _Product tag is equal to `sale`_
  - **AND**
  - _Price is less than $50_.

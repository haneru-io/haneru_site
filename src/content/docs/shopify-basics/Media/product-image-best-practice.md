# Product Image Best Practices  

As an online retailer, images are arguably the most important element involved in selling your products. High-quality imagery not only helps potential buyers make purchasing decisions, but also impacts how your site performs. Poorly optimized images can slow down your store and hurt conversions.  

In this guide, we‚Äôll cover some key things to consider when uploading images to Shopify.

## Image Size  

Not to be confused with **file size** (covered below) ‚Äî *image size* refers to the exact height and width of your image, usually measured in pixels.  

The main consideration is to avoid making your images unnecessarily large. For example, uploading a 4000px-wide image when it only needs to display at 1000px forces browsers to load extra data, which slows down your site.  

üîÆ Shopify‚Äôs recommended dimensions are linked at the bottom of this page.

## File Size  

File size refers to the ‚Äúdigital weight‚Äù of your image ‚Äî how much space it takes up on your server. It‚Äôs typically measured in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB).  

- Larger file sizes usually mean more detail.  
- However, excessively large files can severely impact site speed.  

**Best practice:** Keep product images under **1MB** whenever possible. This strikes the right balance between quality and performance.  

There are several tools available to compress images without noticeably reducing quality.  

:::tip  
My personal recommendation: [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac), which allows you to compress entire folders of images in one go!

## Aspect Ratio  

Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of an image, expressed as two numbers like **16:9** (landscape) or **4:5** (portrait). It defines the *shape* of your image, not its size.  

Because a large percentage of users browse on mobile devices, it‚Äôs important to consider how your images display in both **portrait** and **landscape** viewports.  

Shopify often lets you upload different versions of an image for desktop and mobile. Use this feature to prevent awkward cropping and to ensure the right aspect ratio for each device.

## TL;DR  

- ‚úÖ Upload the correct aspect ratio for your use case.  
- ‚úÖ Always optimize your images before uploading.  
- ‚úÖ Bigger does **not** equal better.
